# Reactive Infiltration {#reactive-infiltration}

[TOC]

This example demonstrates the use of the chemical reactions physics module to compose models for reactive infiltration kinetics, as a solid \f$(S)\f$ material is infiltrated by a liquid \f$(L)\f$ to create a product \f$(P)\f$. The framework and usage of the model is explained below, with both mathematical formulations and example input files.

## Representative Volume Element

The infiltration process for a material considers a cylindrical Representative Volume Element (RVE) with radius \f$R\f$ and span \f$H\f$, depicting a solid capillary of radius \f$r_o\f$, corresponding to the initial porosity of \f$\varphi_0\f$. The mathematical description of the model uses cylindrical coordinates and assumes axisymmetry around \f$r = 0\f$.

As the liquid enters the cylinder, it reacts with a solid to form a product with thickness \f$\delta_P\f$, as shown schematically in the [figure below](@ref infiltration_rve).

[infiltration_rve]: asset/lsi_rve_simplify.svg

Throughout this process, the solid radius, \f$r_o\f$, decreases while the product thickness, \f$\delta_P\f$, increases. Let \f$r_i\f$ denote the inner radius of the product. In addition, define \f$\alpha_i\f$ (in units of mole per volume) as the amount of substance in the RVE, and \f$\Omega_i = \dfrac{M_i}{\rho_i}\f$ as the molar volume of a material with molar mass \f$M_i\f$ (in units of amu, or gram per mole) and density \f$\rho_i\f$ (mass per volume), with subscripts taking \f$L\f$, \f$S\f$, and \f$P\f$, respectively.

The volume fraction, \f$\varphi_i\f$  of each material is then
\f[
    \varphi_i = \alpha_i \Omega_i
\f]
and the RVE porosity (void) is
\f[
    \varphi_v = 1 - \varphi_L - \varphi_P - \varphi_S
\f]

\anchor assumptions

**Key assumptions** made throughout the derivation are:
-  Liquid remains liquid over the entire course of reaction, i.e., no phase change.
-  The reaction is irreversible.
-  Formation of the initial product layer is immediate once liquid comes into contact with solid.
-  Once product is formed, reaction rate is primarily limited by the diffusion of liquid through product to the product-solid interface, with a diffusion coefficient \f$D\f$.
-  The product wall thickness remains uniform during the infiltration.
-  The only reaction is between the liquid and the solid.

The following nondimensionalization is applied to the constitutive model for the reactive infiltration process.
\f{align*}
    &\ \bar{\delta}_P = \frac{\delta_P}{R}, \quad \bar{r}_o = \dfrac{r_o}{R} = \sqrt{1-\varphi_S}, \quad \bar{r}_i = \dfrac{r_i}{R} = \sqrt{1-\varphi_S-\varphi_P}.
\f}

The complete state of the RVE is denoted by the tuple \f$\left( \varphi_L, \varphi_S, \varphi_P\right)\f$, with \f$\alpha_L\f$ as the prescribed force.

> Mathematically, it is possible that \f$ \varphi_L + \varphi_P + \varphi_S \ge 1 \f$. Physically, this implies "overflow", aka the prescribed \f$\alpha_L\f$ is larger than the available voids. Care must be taken at the macroscopic model to avoid or resolve this issue.

## Governing equations

The initial-value problem (IVP) corresponding to the constitutive model is
\f[
    \mathbf{r} = \begin{Bmatrix}
        r_{\varphi_P} \\
        r_{\varphi_S}
    \end{Bmatrix} = \mathbf{0},
\f]
where \f$r_{\varphi_i}\f$ is the residual corresponding to the volume fraction of the liquid, solid and product. The residuals are defined below. Note an implicit backward-Euler time intergration scheme is used.

- Production rate of the product, dictates by the diffusion of the liquid through the product to react with the solid at the product-solid interface
\f[
    r_{\varphi_P} = \dfrac{\alpha_{P, n+1} - \alpha_{P, n}}{t_{n+1}-t_n} - \dfrac{2}{\Omega_L}\dfrac{D}{l_c^2}\dfrac{\bar{r}_o+\bar{r}_i}{\bar{r}_o-\bar{r}_i} R_L R_S
\f]
Here \f$R_L(\varphi_L), R_S(\varphi_S) \in [0, 1]\f$ are the reactivity of liquid and solid, represented by a step function of the void fraction, \f$\varphi_i\f$.

- Reaction rate of the solid, with a (solid, product) reaction coefficient, \f$(k_S, k_P)\f$ respectively
\f[
    r_{\varphi_S} = \dfrac{\alpha_{S, n+1} - \alpha_{S, n}}{t_{n+1}-t_n} + \dfrac{k_P}{k_S} \dfrac{\alpha_{P, n+1} - \alpha_{P, n}}{t_{n+1}-t_n}
\f]

## Implementation details

The above governing equations are fairly general for a wide range of reactive infiltration systems within this framework given the chemical reaction kinetics with appropriate reaction coefficient (\f$k_i\f$) and the corresponding molar volume \f$\Omega_i\f$ of the materials.

Example for determining \f$k_i\f$ and \f$\Omega_i\f$:
Consider a reactive infiltration process of liquid (chemical formula \f$L_x\f$) and solid (\f$S_y\f$), with the molar mass \f$M_L\f$ and \f$M_S\f$. The chemical reaction creates a product with chemical formula \f$L_m S_n\f$, with reaction coefficients \f$k_S\f$ and \f$k_P\f$.
\f[
    L_x + k_S S_y \rightarrow k_P L_mS_n
\f]
For stoichiometric balance, the reaction coefficients are:
\f{align*}
    k_S = \dfrac{xn}{ym}, \quad k_P = \dfrac{x}{m}
\f}
The densities of the liquid, solid, and product are respectively \f$\rho_L, \rho_S, \rho_P\f$.

Then, the molar volume is:
\f[
    \Omega_L = \dfrac{x M_L}{\rho_L}. \quad \Omega_S = \dfrac{y M_S}{\rho_S}, \quad \Omega_P = \dfrac{mM_L+nM_S}{\rho_P}.
\f]


The instantaneous balance also implies that
\f[
    \dot{\alpha}_S = \dfrac{k_P}{k_S} \dot{\alpha}_P,
\f]
Since this constitutive model considers \f$\alpha_L\f$ as the forcing function for the IVP problem, \f$\dot{\alpha}_L \ne k_P \dot{\alpha}_P\f$.
