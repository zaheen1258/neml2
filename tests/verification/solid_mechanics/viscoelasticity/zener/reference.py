Generate the analytical reference solution for the Zener (Standard Linear Solid) viscoelastic
model under a linear strain ramp followed by a hold, written to reference.csv for use by
zener.i / VTestVerification.

The Zener model is an equilibrium spring (E_inf) in parallel with a Maxwell branch (E_M, eta_M).
Letting tau = eta_M / E_M and treating each tensor component independently:

    sigma(t)   = (E_inf + E_M) * eps(t) - E_M * eps_v(t)
    deps_v/dt  = (1/tau) * (eps - eps_v)

For a linear ramp eps(t) = eps0 * t / T_ramp on [0, T_ramp] and hold eps(t) = eps0 for t > T_ramp,
with eps_v(0) = 0, the closed-form viscous strain is:

  During ramp, 0 <= t <= T_ramp:
    eps_v(t) = (eps0 / T_ramp) * t - (eps0 * tau / T_ramp) * (1 - exp(-t/tau))

  After ramp, t > T_ramp:
    eps_v(t) = eps0 - (eps0 * tau / T_ramp) * (exp(T_ramp/tau) - 1) * exp(-t/tau)

Stress follows from the algebraic relation above. CSV columns are written in NEML2's Mandel
SR2 order: xx, yy, zz, yz, xz, xy.
