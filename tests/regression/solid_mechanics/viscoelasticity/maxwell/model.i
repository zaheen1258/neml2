# Maxwell stress relaxation: a single Maxwell element (spring + dashpot in series) under a ramped
# strain. The Maxwell dashpot rate equation is composed with linear isotropic elasticity by
# decomposing the total strain into elastic and viscous parts and applying the elasticity to the
# elastic strain. Under sustained strain the stress relaxes asymptotically to zero.
