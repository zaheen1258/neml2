// This is as simple as calling py::class_, but it is important to do this for ALL tensors up
// front. The reason is for typing: Once we build the neml2 python library with all the necessary
// bindings, we will have to extract all the typing information (mostly function signature) from
// the library, which is needed by language servers like Pylance. We use pybind11-stubgen for that
// purpose. For a type to be deducible by pybind11-stubgen, a concrete definition of the binding
// class must exist at the point of method definition. Therefore, we need to first create all the
// class definitions before creating method bindings that use them as arguments.
