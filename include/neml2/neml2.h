/**
 * Some neml2 libraries use the factory-registry pattern to dynamically register available
 * objects. However, some linkers will not include object files from the library if no symbols
 * from those object files are referenced.
 *
 * Of course, to work around this issue, one can use linker flags like --no-as-needed to force the
 * linker to include all object files from the library. However, this is not an ideal solution as it
 * may break other parts of the link line.
 *
 * The approach we take here is to define a symbol in the neml2_models library that is always
 * referenced when the library is used.
