/**
 * @brief Linear solver using the Schur complement factorization.
 *
 * Solves a block-partitioned system where the system matrix A has at least
 * two variable groups.  Let p denote the primary group index and s the Schur
 * group index.  The block system is
 *
 *   [ A_pp  A_ps ] [ x_p ]   [ b_p ]
 *   [ A_sp  A_ss ] [ x_s ] = [ b_s ]
 *
 * The Schur complement factorization proceeds as
 *
 *   Y   = A_pp^{-1} A_ps           (primary_solver)
 *   z   = A_pp^{-1} b_p            (primary_solver)
 *   S   = A_ss - A_sp Y            (dense arithmetic)
 *   d   = b_s - A_sp z             (dense arithmetic)
 *   x_s = S^{-1} d                 (schur_solver)
 *   x_p = z - Y x_s                (dense arithmetic)
 *
 * The same factorization is used for the matrix RHS overload (AX = B).
